					<h2>AAHAVAN 2K18</h2>
					<p> 
						From historical wrestling to modern cricket, sports have always played a key part in shaping our country's history.Culture and sports are both taken forward by people who dare to follow their dream, and with the same zeal we announce AAHVAAN ‘18, the annual sports fest of DTU. A unique fusion of sports and culture, AAHVAAN is an attempt to pay homage to our athletic heritage. Join us in this journey as we dare to merge thumping hearts with tapping feet at North India’s grandest Inter-Collegiate sports extravaganza from 23rd to 26th March 2018.
